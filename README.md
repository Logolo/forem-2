# Forem [![Build status](http://travis-ci.org/radar/forem.png)](http://travis-ci.org/radar/forem)
*"NO U!"*

Forem is an engine for Rails that aims to be the best little forum system ever.
The end goal is to have an engine that can be dropped into an application that
provides the basic functionality of forums, topics and posts.

**We are currently undergoing large changes.** If you want to use this project, please
keep this in mind. You can view a list of the intended changes on our [Version 1.0
Roadmap](https://github.com/radar/forem/wiki/1.0-Roadmap)

# Demo

A demo application can be found at [http://forem.heroku.com](http://forem.heroku.com), and the source for this application can be found on the [forem.heroku.com
repository](http://github.com/radar/forem.heroku.com)

# Installation

Installing Forem is easy.

## Specify Gem dependencies

    gem 'forem', :git => "git://github.com/radar/forem.git"

## Run the installer

**Ensure that you first of all have a `User` model and some sort of authentication system set up**. We would recommend going with [Devise](http://github.com/plataformatec/devise), but it's up to
you. All Forem needs is a model to link topics and posts to.

Run `rails g forem:install` and answer any questions that pop up. There's sensible defaults there if you don't want to answer them.

And you're done! Yaaay!

For more information on installing, please [see the "Installation" wiki
page](https://github.com/radar/forem/wiki/Installing---Upgrading)

If there's a feature you think would be great to add to Forem, let us know on [the Issues
page](https://github.com/radar/forem/issues)

## Auto Discovery Links
If you would like to add auto discovery links for the built in forum Atom feeds, then add the following method inside your &lt;head&gt; tag:

    <%= forem_atom_auto_discovery_link_tag %>

## Customisation

If you want to customise Forem, you can copy over the views using the (Devise-inspired) `forem:views` generator:

    rails g forem:views

You will then be able to edit the forem views inside the `app/views/forem` of your application. These views will take precedence over those in the engine.

## Translations

We currently have support for the following languages:

* Brazillian (pt-BR)
* Chinese (zh-CN)
* English
* German
* Farsi (Persian)
* Italian
* Russian
* Polish
* Dutch
* Spanish

Patches for new translations are very much welcome!

## OMG BUG! / OMG FEATURE REQUEST!

File an issue and we'll get around to it when we can.

## Developing on forem

Forem is implemented as a Rails engine and its specs are run in the context of a dummy Rails app. The process for getting the specs to run is similar to setting up a regular rails app:

    bundle exec rake forem:dummy_app

Once this setup has been done, Forem's specs can be run by executing this command:

    bundle exec rspec spec

More information can be found in [this issue](https://github.com/radar/forem/issues/24) in the bugtracker.

If all the tests are passing (they usually are), then you're good to go! Develop a new feature for Forem and be lavished with praise!
